# Sudoku-solver
Sudoku gameboard with several different layouts and a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzles.

sudoku-solver-terminal is a terminal version of the Sudoku-solver that demonstrates the backtracking algorithm. You can add board examples into the file and test the algorithm's ability to solve it.

sudoku-solver-gUI contains the actual playable version of Sudoku created using pygame. Player can press spacebar and the algorithm solves the puzzle while visualising in real time what it is computing. Harder Sudoku puzzles may take a while for the algorithm to solve as the visualizing slows the algorithm significantly (1 frame per iteration).
